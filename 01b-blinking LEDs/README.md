A Hello World of sorts 2b
===========

Objectives
-----------
* Introduce reset
* Play around with variables and data types


Findings
--------
* Variables: 
  * Variables used within a process, to store stuff
  * Used for serialized code
  
* Signals
  * Used for interconnecting stuff
  * Used for parallel code
  
* The *keyword* 'OTHERS' refers to "all bits not explicitly assigned" - useful for setting stuff.
  
* std_logic and std_logic_vector used when you need 'bits'
* unsigned used when you need something countable with arithmetic
* integer used for 32 bit values, but not a manly way to do things
