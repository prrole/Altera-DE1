A Hello World of sorts 2
===========

Objectives
-----------
* Introduce a clock
* make a LED blink
* Investigate standard naming/formatting

Findings
--------
* Sigasi got incredibly confused, seems the best way to start a project is to do file->new empty VHDL project and point it to the directory containing the quartus project (i.e. do not import quartus project)
* There are quite a few data types, some of which are bound to be legacy/useless/academic
* There seems to be no standard naming/indent/capitalization, roll your own..
  * all caps for keywords for now
* Signals vs variables is not entirely clear
